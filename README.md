# Air Quality Dashboard (Learning Project) - Learning Frontend Development

## Project Overview
This repository documents my learning journey towards building an air quality dashboard. It contains  standalone learning projects and the final dashboard implementation which builds upon the skills I'll have (hopefully) developed. I'm doing this so that I have **some** frontend development experience, and so that when doing more advanced projects later down the line I am comfortable (or at least able) to write web-based interfaces. 
Another obejective is to finally get more familiar with git, especially using branches.
