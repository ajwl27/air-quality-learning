### CSS Colors - Notes
- You can use named colours, `rgb` (0-255 per channel), `rgba` (rgb with 0-1 alpha channel), `hsl`, `hsla`, or hex colours (hex codes can be abbreviated if the two numbers per channel match, e.g. `#001122` can be written `#012`)
- you can use `background-color` or just `background`
- the [coolors](https://coolors.co) tool is useful for generating colour palletes
- coolors have a [contrast checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5) which is good to make sure text will be legible against the background
